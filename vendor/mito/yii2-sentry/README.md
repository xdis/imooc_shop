Once the extension is installed, set your configuration in common config file:

        'sentry' => [
            'class' => 'mito\sentry\SentryComponent',
            'dsn' => '', // private DSN
            'environment' => YII_CONFIG_ENVIRONMENT, // if not set, the default is `development`
            'jsNotifier' => true, // to collect JS errors
            'clientOptions' => [ // raven-js config parameter
                'whitelistUrls' => [ // collect JS errors from these urls
                    'http://staging.my-product.com',
                    'https://my-product.com',
                ],
            ],
        ],
        'log' => [
            'targets' => [
                [
                    'class' => 'mito\sentry\SentryTarget',
                    'levels' => ['error', 'warning'],
                    'except' => [
                        'yii\web\HttpException:404',
                    ],
                ]
            ],
        ],
    ],
```

To skip collecting errors in the development environment, disable the component with this parameter:

```php
    'components' => [
        'sentry' => [
            'enabled' => false,
        ],
    ],
```
